					<h2>London Elects &mdash;</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="indent">
					<p>The 2021 Mayor of London and London Assembly elections took place a year later than originally planned due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The main objective of this campaign was to inform Londoners of the new date of the elections. My approach referenced the delay in a humorous way by showing the new date hastily plastered over the old, as yet another event that had been postponed.</p>
					<p>The campaign spanned a variety of media, including broadcast video, radio, posters, social media and other digital platforms. Adverts visually referencing LED timetables were also displayed on buses around London.</p>
					<p>Shortlisted for the Inside Out Awards 2021 and Adobe Government Creativity Awards 2021.</p>

					<h2>Covid-19 response &mdash;</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="indent">
					<p>During the Covid-19 pandemic in late 2020, research had shown that young people in London were less likely to wear a face covering in public spaces, and as a result, more likely to spread the virus. The Mayor of London subsequently ran a campaign tackling the issue with this audience.</p>
					<p>My approach aimed to speak to young Londoners with a straight and direct message, avoiding a lot of the patronising and clichéd messaging that was crowding health guidance communications at the time, as well as featuring real Londoners for an authentic reflection of the city. Press ads and social media images accompanied <a href="https://vimeo.com/689867850" target="_blank">a video broadcast on on-demand media services</a>.</p>

					<h2>Whatever The Weather &mdash;</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="indent">
					<p>Homelessness is an issue that often gets ignored during the summer months. This Mayor of London campaign raised awareness of the issue by taking the focus away from the things people usually associate with summer, and inserting basic things that we take for granted.</p>
					<p>The campaign coincided with the launch of a new rapid response initiative, allowing members of the public to refer people sleeping rough to local support services as quickly as possible. Posters were run across the transport network and printed using Pantone neons for extra standout in a visually busy setting.</p>

					<h2>London Is Open &mdash;</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="indent">
					<p>London Is Open is a campaign that has been run continuously by the Mayor of London since the European Union membership referendum in 2016. In the run up to the UK officially leaving the EU, the campaign objective and message shifted to become more urgent, supportive and informative.</p>
					<p>The campaign featured out-of-home displays around London's transport network and other prime locations across the city including Piccadilly Circus and Tower Bridge. Floor decals inspired by welcome mats were placed at stations in areas with high populations of European Londoners, with messages reading ‘London is open’ in different languages, speaking directly to those communities and reassuring them that they will always be a welcome part of the city. A bus adorned with the campaign message toured the city, with legal experts on board offering free advice to European Londoners about their rights and how to apply for settled status.

				<div class="indent">
					<p>Africa in London is a Mayor of London led event programme that celebrates African culture and its importance to London’s identity. The programme was created in partnership with the British Council and various African arts, cultural and heritage organisations.</p>
					<p>For the first edition of an ambitious programme, the promotional material needed to be bold and striking, whilst relevant to the core demographic and engaging to a younger, creative audience. My concept took inspiration from the Afrofuturist cultural movement, using collages of bright coloured images associated with the cultural events on show.</p>

					<p>Every summer, hundreds of volunteers welcome tourists at destinations around the city. Known as London’s ‘friendly face’, the Team London Ambassadors show the world the best we have to offer. Since its inception during the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games in London, the programme has had the same identity, so it was overdue a refresh. The new identity uses a bright and 'friendly' pink to stand out around London's busy tourist attractions, featuring playful illustrations of London's landscape.
